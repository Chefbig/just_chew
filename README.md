# Just Chew

Just Chew is the starter project for the [Winnipeg Ruby User Group](http://winnipegrb.org/) lab meetups. Code along with us and learn something new! This app is a clone of food order/delivery services such as [Just Eat](https://www.just-eat.ca/) or [Skip The Dishes](https://www.skipthedishes.com/) and is built for educational purposes only.

## Prerequisites

In order to run this app, you will need:

1. Ruby `2.3.1` with the `bundler` gem installed. We recommend using rbenv for manging your ruby versions.

2. A JavaScript runtime for Ruby on Rails. Node is commonly used for this.

3. SQLite3 for your development database.

4. PhantomJS for running acceptance tests.
